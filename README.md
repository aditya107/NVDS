This paper proposes a novel night time vehicle detection method combining a novel bio-inspired image enhancement approach and a weighted score-level feature fusion strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our night time image enhancement method can enhance contrast and brightness well and can also preserve and improve the object details, and is better than some state-of-the-art night time image enhancement techniques in terms of contributing to better vehicle detection. Moreover, complementary features are combined linearly using a new weighted score-level feature fusion approach (DPM”, “CNN+SVM”). The vehicles in different types and sizes in complex scenes can be successfully detected with higher success.
The project we have built is a web portal that is able to use the above image enhancements techniques and store the data in a connected database. The backend is build with python code that successfully implements the Computervision features in the project.
